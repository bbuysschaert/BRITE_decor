Currently, we only have the 'devel' directory.  In the near future, after some initial testing, most of the routines will be transferred to a 'stable' repository.  This directory will then solely be used for testing of new implemntations.


NOTES on the current routines (ToDo)

Include the itertools for acf.acdnD (itertools.product)

Remove the redundant statements for the bandpassfilter.
